# FINM 36700: Portfolio Theory and Risk Management
## Autumn 2021

This is the repo for all code corresponding to the course, published by the instructor or teaching assistants.

### solutions
- Homework Solutions, created by the Teaching Assistants
- Hopmework Discussions, created by the Instructor

### data
- Data sets supporting the `Solutions` folder code.
- The data sets are small enough that it is not a problem to track them in git

### build_data
- This folder provides notebooks used to build all the homework data sets.
- They are provided for those interested in how to get and organize data directly.
- At some point in the future, the `data` folder may be removed, requiring users to generate the data files from these notebooks.

### cmds
- Supporting functions routinely used in the code.
- For this course, it consists of a single file, `portfolio.py`
- A few demos make use of an unpublished file in this folder, `factor_pricing.py`. This file is not provided, but you can still see the results of the factor pricing demos.

### demos
- A few coding demonstrations used in class.
- Most of our in-class discussions revolve around the Homework Discussion notebooks in `solutions`.
