    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution: False.** Mathematically, we saw high dividend price ratios could lead to high future returns, low future dividends, or something else. The fact that they seem to lead to high future returns is an empirical statistical fact, not a mathematical necessity. </span>\n",

This decades-long rise in prices-per-cashflow increased returns, but there seems to be little room for further gains in P/D and P/E ratios. Accordingly, they believe the equity premium will not be as high as it had been historically. </span>\n",

    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:** GMO is, in a macro sense, a value investor. They invest in asset classes with low prices per cash flow.

    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> **Solution:** There are multiple things to say here. The most obvious is that they benchmarked the strategy to a constant 6% per year. While this was the average risk-free rate over previous decades, the risk-free rate was much lower going forward. Accordingly, Barnstable was actually betting on the level of stock return performance, not just that they would outperform the risk-free rate. \n",

    "<span style=\"color:#00008B\"> A second notable problem is the Trust strategy. Barnstable would essentially sell all exposure to stock underperformance and retain exposure to overperformance.
