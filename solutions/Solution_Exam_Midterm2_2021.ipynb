    "## 1. Short Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1:** \n",
    "False. If the factors work perfectly for pricing, then together they span the tangency. This means that a portfolio of the factors has the maximum Sharpe ratio--it says nothing about their individual Sharpe ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2:**\n",
    "Depends. True if \"investment\" beta refers to the factor which is conservative minus agressive investment, which actually means beta to a low-investment factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "False if interpreted as beta to high (strong) investment. Fama-French find that correlation to conservative (low) investment is what boosts mean returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.3:**\n",
    "Even if individual Sharpe Ratios are zero, they may have substantial marginal impact on a portfolio with just the market factor. So looking at their univariate stats is not enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, reasonable to point out that weak mean returns mean they may not be as important as DFA thought at the time of the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.4:**\n",
    "Nothing. Fama-French does not make any prediction about how the asset's characteristics impacts mean returns. It only predicts that the asset's beta impacts returns. Thus, if it has zero correlation (and thus zero beta) to the factors, then its expected return in the model is zero. And its characteristic beyond that is irrelevant to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.5:**\n",
    "The construction of the momentum portfolio does two things:\n",
    "* diversifies idiosyncratic risk by going long lots of winners and shorting lots of losers. Not just going long-short the most extreme, but in Fama-French construction, utilizing top/bottom 30%!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid too much turnover by ranking winners and losers on rolling 12 month period rather than a single period. This smoothes the ranking and reduces turnover.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.6:**\n",
    "A long-only momentum fund is extremely correlated to the market equity factor, as seen in HW#6, section 2. (Note that you did not need to do Section 1 to answer this.) This greatly reduces the attractiveness of momentum relative to its long-short construction, which has higher Sharpe and near zero correlation to the market equity factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.7:**\n",
    "* We know NOTHING about their time-series regression fits as seen in R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "* All their Treynor ratios should be identical, and equal to the market premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "* All their information ratios should be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.8:**\n",
    "* The Central Limit Theorem supported this. One could note that the assumptions were extreme, but the overall results support this. (Barnstable made the more tenuous bet that it would outperform a constant 6% rate, but we asked about the risk-free rate.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is extremely likely given the mathematics of how means versus volatilities compound. Though the log iid assumption is strong, we saw much evidence that Sharpe ratios grow nearly with the square-root of the horizon, which would make the 100-year Sharpe about 10x the 1-year Sharpe.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is definitely false. The volatility of the cumulative return GROWS with the horizon. The Central Limit Theorem gave the result that the volatility of the *average* return shrinks with the horizon, (see the first bullet point,) but that the volatility of the *cumulative* return grows with horizon."
